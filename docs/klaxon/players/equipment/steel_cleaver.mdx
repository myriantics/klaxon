### **Attacking**

The Steel Cleaver is a **Shield Breaching** weapon. If you perform a fully-charged attack with it on an entity using a Shield, it will disable that shield and deal damage through it.

It also comes with **Innate Looting I.**

### **Usage**

The Steel Cleaver mimicks Axe functionality on usage - it can strip bark off of logs and wax / oxidation off of copper blocks.

### **Mining**

The Steel Cleaver is a **Instabreak Tool** - it has a set of blocks that it can instantly break no matter the circumstance. For the Steel Cleaver, this includes congealed / biological blocks such as **Rubber, Moss, and Sculk.**.

It can also mine anything that an Axe can.
