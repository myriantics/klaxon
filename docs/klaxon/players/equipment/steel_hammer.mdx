### **Attacking**

The Steel Hammer doubles the strength of **knockback hits** (sprint hits). This switches the attacking damage type from Bonking to Walloping.

### **Usage**

Use the Steel Hammer near any dropped item to Hammer it. This has one of three outcomes.

- **Noisemaker**
    - Makes a sound and particles on the dropped item. Trips Sculk sensors.
- **Tool Usage Recipe**
    - The target item will be hammered into a Plate or Sheet.
- **Anvil Mimicry**
    - The item in your offhand will be applied to the target dropped item if possible.

### **Wall Jumping**

Attack the ground with a full attack bar and positive Y velocity to launch yourself backwards into the air.

If you hold another Steel Hammer in your offhand, **Dual Wielding** will activate - boosting the strength of your walljump.

If an Observer is facing into the block that you walljump off of, that Observer will be **activated**.

Having the **Strength** effect will boost the strength of your walljump, but having the **Weakness** effect or any **Entity Weight** will decrease it.

### **Mining**

The Steel Hammer is a **Instabreak Tool** - it has a set of blocks that it can instantly break no matter the circumstance. For the Steel Hammer, this includes shatterable / fragile blocks such as **Glass, Ice, and Crystal Buds**.

It can also break Beacons faster.
